## Integration with Real API

To connect to the actual Elevare AI backend:

1. Replace `mockAICall` with real API call:
```typescript
const callAI = async (prompt: string, tasks?: Task[]): Promise<AIResponse> => {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/ai/suggest', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, currentTasks: tasks })
  })
  return response.json()
}
```

2. Update error handling and loading states as needed
